### About me ### 

My name is Patrick I'm on the analytics team @ Airbnb. Over the past 4 years I've worked on a variety of different teams & projects at high-growth marketplace companies, responsiblites ranging from supporting product teams (feature deep dives, experimentation design & analysis, events instrumentation, churn + retention modeling) to the optimization of marketing channels (media mix modeling, referral incentives, channel attribution, utm instrumentation) and improving operational efficiency (logistics fleet efficiency, market expansions, onboarding). And now I'm working in Sales!

### About this Repo ###
