### What's in this repo? ### 

Welcome to my repository of miscellaneous data-related projects! My name is Patrick and I'm currently a Data Scientist @ Airbnb.

Unfortunately for most data-nerds, it's hard to justify working on some projects  the things , when often times business needs dictate me to work on other projects. 

I'm excited to share some one-off projects I've taken on outside of work (this year I've decided that I'd like to develop more of a web footprint!).
