### About me ### 

My name is Patrick I'm on the analytics team @ Airbnb. Over the past 4 years I've worked within a variety of different teams at high-growth marketplace companies, with responsiblites ranging from **supporting product teams** (feature deep dives, experimentation design & analysis, events instrumentation, churn + retention modeling) to **optimizing marketing channels** (media mix modeling, referral incentives, channel attribution, utm instrumentation) **and also improving operational efficiency** (logistics fleet efficiency, market expansions, onboarding). And now I'm working on Sales Analytics!
