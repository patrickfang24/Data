### Welcome! ### 

Welcome to my repository of miscellaneous data-related projects! My name is Patrick and I'm currently a Data Scientist @ Airbnb.

I'm excited to share some of the one-off projects I've taken on outside of work. __< some tie to next sentence >__ Data Science encompasses a wide variety of different fields, ranging from Data Engineering to Advanced Statistical Analysis. and you can truly spend more than a lifetime mastering single field. 

__< Why is important to be well-roudned >__ 
__< To add image of branches of data science >__

Unfortunately for data-nerds who want to learn all facets of the craft, work projects != leveling-up projects, as it can be hard to justify working on certain types of projects that are essential for personal growth & development (Predictive Modeling, Experimentation, Web Scraping, Visualization, etc.) when __immediate business requirements__ dictate your time spent on other types of projects. 

As a result, I believe that self-study is an important habit to become a well-rounded data person, and conducive of accelerating your growth trajectory as a data scientist. (Remember, ABTFDSMTYNFB! - Always be training & flexing data science muscles that you've never flexed before!) Take time during lunch, commute, or a couple hours over the weekend to level-up!
